## App Summary

Are you a fan of Microsoft Paint? Do you ever wish you could paint on one canvas along with your friends? *Now, you can!* Paint with different colors, brush sizes, and fill screen colors in the Collaborative Paint application. 

## Details

  When you run the program, **two windows** will pop up: a GUI window and display window. Draw in the *GUI window,* or click its operation buttons, to see your painting operations reflected in the *display window*. You can undo and redo other clients' actions, just like in a collaborative online document!
  Please see milestone 7: Build Instructions for instructions to build and run the application. <br>
